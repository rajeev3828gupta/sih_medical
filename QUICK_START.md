   # Terminal 2 (for second device)
   npx react-native run-android --deviceId=YOUR_DEVICE_ID
   ```

3. **For iOS devices:**
   ```powershell
   npx react-native run-ios --simulator="iPhone 14"
   npx react-native run-ios --simulator="iPhone 15"
   ```

### Method 2: Physical Devices

1. **Connect multiple Android phones** via USB
2. **Enable USB debugging** on all devices
3. **Check connected devices:**
   ```powershell
   adb devices
   ```
4. **Deploy to each device:**
   ```powershell
   npx react-native run-android --deviceId=DEVICE_1_ID
   npx react-native run-android --deviceId=DEVICE_2_ID
   ```

### Method 3: Mixed (Web + Mobile)

1. **Start web version:**
   ```powershell
   cd "c:\Users\RAJEEV GUPTA\OneDrive\Desktop\sih_medical\mobile"

2. **Navigate to "Multi-Device Sync Demo"** screen
3. **Check connection status** - should show green ‚úÖ
4. **Test real-time sync:**
   - Add data on Device 1
   - Watch it appear instantly on Device 2
   - Try editing from either device

## üîß Quick Commands

### Start Server
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\RAJEEV GUPTA\OneDrive\Desktop\sih_medical\sync-server"
node server.js
```

### List Devices
```powershell
# Android
adb devices

# iOS Simulators  
xcrun simctl list devices available
```

### Deploy to Specific Device
```powershell

- [ ] Multiple devices connected to WiFi (192.168.1.x network)
- [ ] App deployed on all devices
- [ ] Multi-Device Demo shows green connection status
- [ ] Data syncs in real-time between devices

## üÜò Troubleshooting

**Server won't start:**
```powershell
netstat -an | findstr :8080  # Check if port is in use
```

**Can't connect to server:**
- Check IP address (should be 192.168.1.7)
- Verify all devices on same WiFi network
- Check Windows Firewall settings

**App won't deploy:**
```powershell
npx react-native doctor  # Check environment
